## Features Setup

The boilerplate uses a modular **features system** to extend baseline functionality. Features are implemented as Higher-Order Components (HOCs), context providers, or similar abstractions, making it easy to integrate additional functionality like data management, authentication, or logging. This approach ensures flexibility and scalability as the project evolves.
