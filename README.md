# ReactBoilerPlate

This project is to create a new boilerplate for ReactJS projects.

The main goal is to configure the application rather than build it out.
We will assume @material-ui is in use and import it core components.
For routing we will use ReactDOM
Themeing is also through the use of @material-ui

This is a public project, as such is open for modification, review, and genral use.  The boilerplate is provide as is and no guarantee is provided.
